</section>

	<!-- 5.1) finding relevant literature: Höök-->
<section>
		<p class="fragment">In the context of interactive digital art, what is

<!-- 5.2) finding relevant literature: Candy-->
<section>
	<p class="fragment">Furthermore, Candy suggests that those artists and practitioners </span>
		<span class="fragment">who engage in the active evaluation of </span>
		<span class="fragment">their interactive artworks, </span>
		<span class="fragment">“are inevitably introduced </span>
		<span class="fragment">to new ways of thinking </span>

<!-- 5.3) concrete approach: show your work-->
<section>
	<p class="fragment">[I] show your work</p>
	<p class="fragment">and listen to what others have to say about it</p>
</section>

</section>

<!-- 8.2) conclusion: what are the desires that lead to physical movement?-->
<section>
<p>
	<span class="fragment">... but this was <em>a very important observation. </em></span>
	<span class="fragment">Up until now I had focused on serious factors like
		<em>freedom</em> or <em>peace</em>, </span>
	<span class="fragment">but this comment called my attention to the fact that: </span>
	<span class="fragment">the factors that inspire us to <em>physically move our bodies</em>
		are so very different depending on our life circumstances. </span>
		<span class="fragment">For some, it is <em>IKEA</em>
			that prompts us to cross.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="fragment">That's why <em>IKEA</em> seems a ridiculous reason to cross a border: </span>
	<span class="fragment">because the border between Finland
		and Sweden is Schengen - it is an open border.</span>
</p>
<p>
		<span class="fragment">But in fact, there is a border there.</span>
</p>
</section>

<!-- 8.3) evolution: so many factors inspire us to move -->
<section>
	<p>
		<span class="fragment">But that user comment inspired me to add IKEA to my list. </span>
		<span class="fragment">And as I saw my particles moving to reach IKEA, </span>
		<span class="fragment">I realised that my piece was actually about </span>
		<span class="fragment">my struggle to articulate and convey </span>
		<span class="fragment">migration as <em>movement, </em></span>
		<span class="fragment">and about my desire to portray the relationship between individuals </span>
		<span class="fragment">and their desires </span>
		<span class="fragment">as one that can result in physical movement </span>
		<span class="fragment"> [or at least a desire for physical movement] </span>
		<span class="fragment">irrelevant of whether there are borders, </span>
		<span class="fragment">wether physical or psychological, </span>
		<span class="fragment">societal, religous, political, </span>
		<span class="fragment">etc. </span>
	</p>
</section>

<!-- 8.4) evolution: so many factors inspire us to move -->
<section>
		<p class="fragment">Incidentally, last weekend, I was not able to physically
			move myself to <em>"IKEA"</em>,
			<span class="fragment">even though it is only 15km away </span>
			<span class="fragment">and in a <em>zone</em> that I perceive as
			being part of the Porto metropolitan area, </span>
			<span class="fragment">that is, within the zone that I habitually move myself in</span>
			<span class="fragment">because of restrictions on movement due to the pandemic.</span>
